# Contributing to the Diagrams Gem

First off, thank you for considering contributing! Your help is appreciated.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

*   Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/seuros/diagram-ruby/issues).
*   If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/seuros/diagram-ruby/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

*   Open a new issue to discuss your enhancement suggestion. Explain why this enhancement would be useful and provide details on your proposed implementation if possible.

### Pull Requests

*   Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` (or the main development branch).
*   If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
*   If you've changed APIs, update the documentation (README, YARD comments).
*   Ensure the test suite passes (`bundle exec rake test`).
*   Make sure your code lints (`bundle exec rubocop`).
*   Issue that pull request!
