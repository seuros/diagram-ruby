module Diagrams
  module Elements # Corrected namespace
    module Types
      # Define common types used in elements if needed, or rely on Dry::Types inference.
      # Example:
      # type StrictString = ::String
      # type StrictFloat = ::Float
      # type StrictArray[T] = ::Array[T]
      # type String? = StrictString?
      # ... etc ...

      # Include the Dry::Types module interface (basic representation)
